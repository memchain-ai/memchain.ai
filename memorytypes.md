# Cognitive Memory Types

Our cognitive memory platform is designed to empower agentic AI systems with a robust, human-like memory architecture. It supports a wide range of memory types, including short-term memory for transient data, long-term memory for persistent knowledge retention, semantic memory for structured facts and concepts, and episodic memory for contextualized experiences.

Additionally, the platform incorporates procedural memory for learned behaviors and skills, as well as working memory for active reasoning and task execution. With support for prospective and emotional memory modules, our system enables AI agents to plan ahead, adapt to context, and evolve continuously. This comprehensive memory model advances the development of autonomous, memory-driven intelligence.
