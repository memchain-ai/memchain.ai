# What MemChain AI Offers

MemChain AI is a purpose-built memory platform that supports the next generation of intelligent, autonomous agents. Large language models on their own are stateless and forgetful. To reason, plan, and act effectively, agents need structured and persistent memory. 

MemChain AI offers scoped memory at the global, tenant, and agent level, with secure sharing, semantic and graph search, summarization, and token-based access. Built for production, it supports audit logging, multi-tenancy, and flexible deployment across self-hosted, cloud, and hybrid setups.
