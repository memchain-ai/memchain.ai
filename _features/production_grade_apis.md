# Overview
<p class="lead">
MemChain AI is built for real-world use, which means its APIs are designed to meet the demands of enterprise deployments from day one. These APIs are not just functional, they are hardened for scale, security, and reliability. Whether you're integrating a single agent or managing a global fleet of autonomous systems, MemChain’s API layer ensures stable and predictable behavior under load.

At the core, all APIs are exposed through a well-documented **FastAPI** interface, backed by strict schema validation using Pydantic models. This eliminates ambiguity in input and output formats, allowing developers to build confidently and catch issues early. Every endpoint includes clear definitions for required parameters, data types, and response structures.

**Security** is a top priority. All endpoints are protected with token-based authentication, and support optional signing for stronger identity guarantees. Tokens are scoped, meaning that they carry embedded metadata to control what a client can access, down to the memory scope or tenant level. This ensures agents cannot operate outside their assigned boundaries. Rate limiting, request logging, and access auditing are also in place to track usage patterns and detect anomalies.

MemChain also follows API best practices like **versioning**, consistent error handling, and idempotent behavior where applicable. This makes the platform easy to maintain and evolve over time without breaking client integrations. Combined with automated testing using pytest and contract tests, MemChain’s APIs are ready for production at scale, with the reliability and security enterprises expect.

## Production-Grade APIs
<p class="lead">
MemChain AI follows an API-first design that supports both internal components and external integrations. Every major feature, from memory storage to semantic search and federation, is exposed through a structured and versioned API. These APIs are not an afterthought. They are the foundation on which the entire platform is built.
</p>

<p class="lead">
Internally, MemChain AI uses its own APIs for everything. The backend services, CLI tools, and orchestration layers all interact through the same endpoints that external users access. This design choice enforces consistency and reliability across the board. If something works through the API, it works across the platform.

<p class="lead">
Testing is treated as a core part of the development lifecycle. Pytest is used to run a comprehensive suite of API-level tests, covering both common and edge-case scenarios. The goal is to maintain over 85 percent test coverage, focusing on real usage patterns instead of isolated function tests. Every API call is validated under simulated conditions to ensure that the system behaves as expected.

<p class="lead">
Security, versioning, and contract stability are built into every endpoint. Token-based authentication with scoped access ensures that each request respects tenant and agent boundaries. Detailed logging and audit trails help track access, and structured error handling provides clear feedback to developers. All of this ensures that MemChain’s APIs are stable, secure, and ready for enterprise use in production environments.
