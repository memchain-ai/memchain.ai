Agents and tenants can securely share memories using fine-grained permissions. Agents are now able to share memories with each other!

## Federated Memory Sharing
<p class="lead">
Federated Memory Sharing in MemChain AI allows agents and tenants to collaborate across organizational or operational boundaries without compromising on control or security. Unlike traditional memory systems that are siloed or centralized, MemChain supports selective, permission-based sharing of memory between agents, teams, or even entire tenants.
</p>

<p class="lead">
This capability is critical for real-world agent ecosystems where knowledge often needs to flow across contexts. For example, a customer service agent in one department may need to access summarized insights from a sales agentâ€™s memory. With MemChain, this is possible through scoped federation, where agents can share specific memories or allow summarization of their data without giving up full visibility or ownership.
</p>

<p class="lead">
Federated sharing is always explicit. Owners of a memory scope must grant access before any other agent or tenant can read, summarize, or search that memory. Permissions are fine-grained, supporting actions like view, summarize, and share. Every access is authenticated, logged, and traceable, giving enterprises full visibility into what is shared, with whom, and under what conditions.

## Why Federation of Memory Management is unique to MemChain AI
<p class="lead">
What makes MemChain's approach unique is that federation is built into the memory model itself. There is no need for manual data copying, out-of-band coordination, or insecure workarounds. Shared access operates through secure APIs, with strict enforcement of scope boundaries and token-based validation. Other platforms either lack this feature entirely or require custom integrations that are hard to maintain and scale.
</p>

<p class="lead">
By making federation native, MemChain enables agent networks that are both autonomous and cooperative. Enterprises can design intelligent workflows where knowledge is distributed but still governed. This unlocks use cases like multi-agent planning, cross-tenant automation, and collaborative reasoning, all while preserving control and accountability.
